# e-Commerce App with Reactjs and Nextjs :shopping_cart:

This project is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)/[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) e-Commerce emulation. The store listings are provided by the [Fake Store Api](https://fakestoreapi.com/). Styling was done with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). This app allows you to mimic shopping on an e-Commerce site, add listings to favorites, and even checkout using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
